           Discover your local skatespots in Shanghai. Users can find, create and share skatespots with their WeChat contacts.

             Skate City was created during my time at Le Wagon Shanghai. I was part of a team of 4 and my role was the front end developer. The video below was part of Demo Day where I pitched the app to industry experts, family and friends. There were many challenges as we attempted to navigate WeChat Mini Programs for the first time. One of the features I worked on was creating the filter tags with JavaScript so users could select and browse different skate styles.

                To the right is an updated version with a my own UI design as I wanted the design to look more fresh and modern.
